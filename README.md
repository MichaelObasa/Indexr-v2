# Indexr v2

Indexr is the Vanguard of Web3 - a non-custodial, on-chain basket protocol that lets users invest into themed crypto baskets (e.g. "Top 10", "AI", "DeFi") via smart contracts on Arbitrum. Users deposit USDC and receive vault tokens representing proportional ownership of the underlying basket. 

EchoPay is the recurring investing engine that automates periodic deposits into Indexr baskets from user wallets. Think Direct Debits for Crypto.
